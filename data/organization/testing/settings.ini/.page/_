<p>Lens will automatically create this settings file for you when you first run Lens.</p>

<p>Here’s an example:</p>

<div class="file">
	<div>settings.ini</div>
	<pre><code><a href="#src">src</a> = <i>'../src'</i>
<a href="#autoload">autoload</a> = <i>'autoload.php'</i></code></pre>
</div>


<h2 id="src">src</h2>

<p>The path to your source-code directory, relative to the Lens directory (the one that contains this settings file).</p>

<p>Set this to <samp>null</samp> if you’d like Lens to find your source-code directory automatically.
Lens will find your source-code directory automatically if you name it “src” and put it in your project root.
If you’d like to use a different path, then set this value to your custom source-code directory path.</p>

<p>This source-code directory path is important for the code-coverage report.
Lens will show code coverage only for the files that are in your source-code directory.
Lens uses this path to suppress irrelevant coverage information about your third-party dependencies.</p>

<h2 id="autoload">autoload</h2>

<p>The path to your “<a href="/organization/testing/autoload.php/">autoload.php</a>” file, relative to the Lens directory (the one that contains this settings file).</p>

<p>Set this to <samp>null</samp> if you’d like Lens to find your autoload file automatically.
Lens will find your autoload file automatically if you’re using Composer, or if you have an autoload file named “autoload.php” in your Lens directory.</li>
If you’d like to use a different autoload path, then set this value to your custom autoload file path (relative to the Lens directory).</p>

<p>Lens uses your autoload file not only to run your unit tests, but also to generate the code coverage report.</p>
