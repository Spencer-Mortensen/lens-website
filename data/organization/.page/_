<p>Most people organize their project using the directory structure from the menu on the right:</p>

<p>However, you only need to create the “<a href="/organization/src/">src/</a>” and “<a href="/organization/testing/tests/">tests/</a>” directories.
Lens will generate everything else for you as it becomes relevant.</p>

<p>If you’re using Composer, then you’re good to go!
Otherwise, you should create an “<a href="/organization/testing/autoload.php/">autoload.php</a>” file for your project.</p>

<p>You are ready to write your first <a href="/tests-file/">unit test</a>!</p>
