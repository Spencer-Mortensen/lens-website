<h2>Your time is valuable</h2>

<p><b>Lens reduces the time spent unit testing by over 50%.</b>
How many hours have you spent writing and testing code?
Imagine what you could accomplish if <i>half</i> your time were returned to you.</p>


<h2>You’re at risk</h2>

<p>Assertion-based frameworks only check the specific values in your assertions.
<b>What about new side effects?</b>
At any time, you could be bitten by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a malicious system call buried in a merge request</li>
	<li>a suppressed warning that could have revealed a big issue</li>
	<li>a forgotten debugging statement that will now break your AJAX</li>
	<li>a new pass-by-reference behavior that will overwrite your variables</li>
</ul>

<p>If it wasn’t explicitly asserted, <i>it didn’t get checked.</i>
Assertion-based frameworks won’t check every side effect.
<b>Lens will.</b></p>


<h2>You want 100%</h2>
