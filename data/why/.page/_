<h3>Be more productive</h3>

<p>In most frameworks, unit tests are a mix of framework code and the code being tested.
Lens simplifies things by eliminating the framework code.
<b>Lens eliminates over 50% of the work of writing unit tests.</b></p>

<p>Lens tests are easy to read and quick to write.
See for yourself!
Take a look at some of the <:link "unit tests" "get-started/write-a-test/":> to see how simple Lens really is.</p>


<h3>Catch more issues</h3>

<p>Assertion-based frameworks can only catch the very specific issues that you explicitly check.
Lens checks all of the side effects from running your source code.
As a result, Lens catches everything—fatal errors, exceptions, changes to global variables, surprise echo statements—literally everything that can go wrong.
<b>Lens catches everything, always and automatically.</b></p>
